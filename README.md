# Florl (*floral*)

florl is an open-source framework to develop federated reinforcement learning (FRL) applications.

Our framework builds upon [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) and [TorchRL](https://github.com/pytorch/rl). 

This project is in active development. Check out a [report](https://github.com/MarkHaoxiang/florl/blob/l361-submission/report/fl_florl_report.pdf) that detailed a past version and the original motivations for this project.

Currently, this project is in active development and not yet functional. However, branch `l361-submission` contains a suite of FRL experiments that may be useful for reference.

## Installation

### Development

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage local development environments.
