# Florl (*floral*)

Training federated reinforcement learning with Flower.

## Project

Together with https://github.com/MarkHaoxiang/ros2_flower_rl, forms part of my Federated Learning course project for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos at Cambridge.

As only I have requested a project extension, please see branch `zc344-submission` for an older snapshot of the codebase on the deadline for Xavier's submission. The newer commits to `main`, up to the deadline of `22/03/2024`, contains only my work.

See https://github.com/MarkHaoxiang/florl/tree/main/report for division of work and report.


## Installation

Clone this repository, and then `pip install .`
